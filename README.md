# Healthcare Management Portal

## Project Overview

The Healthcare Management Portal is an innovative solution that aims to enhance the efficiency and collaboration within the healthcare sector. This project was inspired by the challenges highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the global healthcare system faced unprecedented strains. The portal connects doctors, surgeons, pharmacists, and receptionists to streamline communication, optimize time management, and provide real-time insights.

## Features

1. **Medicine Demand Prediction**: The `med_supply_predictor_model.py` script utilizes machine learning to forecast the demand for specific medicines in the future. This predictive model enables proactive stock management and ensures that essential medicines are available when needed.

2. **Pharmacy Location Analysis**: The `pharmacy_location_analysis.py` script performs a geographical analysis of pharmacy locations. It helps in identifying optimal locations for setting up new pharmacies based on demand patterns and existing pharmacy distribution.

3. **User-Friendly Front End**: The front-end of the website provides an intuitive interface for doctors, surgeons, pharmacists, and receptionists to collaborate effectively. It offers real-time communication, data visualization, and user-specific dashboards.

## Dataset Usage

As part of a hackathon challenge, a dummy dataset was utilized for this project instead of real-world COVID-19 datasets. This decision was made to foster creativity and develop an original solution rather than relying on pre-existing analysis models. While the project was initially inspired by the healthcare challenges posed by COVID-19, its scope extends beyond pandemic scenarios. The portal's features are designed to improve healthcare management overall and can adapt to various healthcare crises.

## How to Use

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Run `med_supply_predictor_model.py` to train the medicine demand prediction model.
3. Execute `pharmacy_location_analysis.py` to perform pharmacy location analysis.
4. Set up the front-end interface by following the instructions provided in the respective files.

## Future Enhancements

This project is designed to address the immediate challenges highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic while also remaining adaptable to various healthcare scenarios. Future enhancements could include integrating real-world data, refining predictive models, and expanding collaboration features to further improve healthcare management.

## Note

While this project was initiated in response to COVID-19, it reflects a broader commitment to improving healthcare systems. The use of a dummy dataset underscores our dedication to innovative problem-solving and demonstrates our determination to build solutions from the ground up.

Please feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or suggest improvements to make this portal even more effective and impactful.
